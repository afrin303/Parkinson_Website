      <p className="description">
      This study introduces an innovative method for Parkinson's disease detection using MRI images and diagnostic tests like the Spiral and Wave tests. Leveraging deep learning techniques, particularly neural networks, the model demonstrates remarkable accuracy in identifying Parkinson's disease indicators. By analyzing MRI patterns and performance in diagnostic tests, this approach offers a non-invasive and automated diagnostic solution. Integrating deep learning with medical imaging and clinical assessments holds promise for early Parkinson's disease detection.
